# Bootstrapping

Bootstrapping sucks.

We've got sample inputs, but no guidance as to what the interface
should look like.  How do we connect to the input and output?  In
a coding contest, the conditions of contest would normally define
the interface that will be used by the judging framework to probe
the solution.

So my starting point is the assumption that I'm integrating with
the java framework; meaning that I'm going to nominate my composition
root by providing a class name, and the `main(String [] args)`
method of that class will be invoked; with the input provided via
stdin, the output gathered via stdout, and any errors gathered via
stderr.

Given that, I want the functional core to be something that is
conveniently invoked by main under these conditions.  This problem
is somewhat simpler, in that there are no references to command
line arguments or expected errors, so I can focus on stdin and stdout.

The goal is to have my testable core within a trivial shell.  So I
can imagine that `main` would just pass the streams into the core.
Therefore, my test framework should anticipate a similar interface.
