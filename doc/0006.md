# Collisions

I've been completely skipping the grid up to this point, because I
didn't have any test behavior that actually needed it.  I found a
later version of the kata that suggested the following rule

_If an obstacle is present at the coordinates that the rover would
move to, the rover should halt the execution of the program.

I interpret this to mean that the rover should run until it is
obstructed, at which point all subsequent instructions should
be no-ops.  The rover will shut down in the state where the
obstacle was detected, and the position and orientation that it
reports will be that in which the obstacle was detected.

The grid is key, here, as it will act as the tracker of the occupied
positions in the simulation as rovers move around.

But I don't have one yet, and I'm not quite sure how the interactions
between the rovers is going to play out.  So the basic plan looks like
this

 * RED: introduce a new entry point specialized for this use case
 * GREEN: simplest hack that could possibly work
 * REFACTOR: flesh out the new implementation, borrowing where I can
from what already works
 * RED: introduce the same test against the legacy entry point
 * GREEN: shunt to the new implementation
 * REFACTOR: remove duplication
