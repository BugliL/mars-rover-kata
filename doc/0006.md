# Wiring the output to the input

OK, this particular hack comes out of left field, but it makes
sense for this particular problem: we're trying to figure out
what the positions of the rovers are when their programs end.
Another way to reach the same terminal position is to start
in the final location with an empty program.

I've basically switched from hard coding the answer to hard
coding the work; very slightly different.
