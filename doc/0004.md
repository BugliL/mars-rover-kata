 # Test Calibration

 Since all of my tests are coming through this single choke point in the API,
 I can create a mess of failures by introducing a short circuit.
 
 Of course, this wouldn't work if I needed a passing test for the case where
 no output is generated.  I'm willing to pay off to that one.  Maybe at that
 point I rewrite the shunt to emit identifiable garbage.
 
 Running the tests with the short circuit engaged, I get two failures out of
 two.  Furthermore, I can see from the summary that they are failures (the
 checks tripped their asserts), not errors or skips.
 
 In other words, my checks are detecting incorrect outputs.  Good.
