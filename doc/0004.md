# Ports and Adapters

With the command line API assumption, we're effectively
designing a filter.  So we can immediately recognize that
we should expect to end up with the following design elements

* an adapter that delivers data from the boundary
* a function that transforms the data
* an adapter that delivers data to the boundary
* a protocol to orchestrate the cooperation of the elements
* a composition root to wire everything together
