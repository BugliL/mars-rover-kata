# A simple way to specify behavior

The notion of pushing files to the system under test is basically
right, but clumsy; I want to be able to define a new constraint on
the behavior by just typing, and relatively quickly.

There could be a structured approach taken here, but we're out at
the boundary anyway, so maybe just assembling byte arrays that
have the right structure to them is the right sort of idea.

One of the ideas driving this approach is that the tests are
scaffolding; as Kent Beck says, we're being paid for code that
works, not for tests.  So these tests are quick, dirty things
that are supposed to help smoke out the right design, but are
inherently disposable.

We still have the original ExampleTest to fall back on if necessary.
