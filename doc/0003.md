# Faking the data

There's a problem with this acceptance test, as it currently stands: it's really
not obvious from the test how much of the implementation is actually available.
When the test has the specification encoded directly into it, it's easy to
see what's going on.  Without that, what does GREEN actually tell you.

Anyway, I took a couple of false starts here before I realized that the simplest
thing was to match on the data that is in the sample file, which introduces
the duplication I need to then start generalizing.
