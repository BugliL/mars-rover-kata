# Remove Duplication

At this point, we've got what is effectively a pure function.  That
implies that the output can be completely derived from the inputs.
Therefore, all we need to do is tease out the duplication.

In the past, I've done this drill by adding additional little tests
to help tease out the next bit of duplication, but that really
shouldn't be necessary; we don't need more test cases, just better
vision.

There isn't, of course, anything wrong with starting with a simpler
example, then incrementally adding complexity.
