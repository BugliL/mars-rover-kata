# Embarrassing Error

Because I am currently treating the rover state as a mutable object
rather than as an immutable value, I was able to write my anonymous
instructions with internal references to the declared instance.

The powerful thing here is that I could not figure out a test to
write, given the limited interface, which would expose the problem.

I guess that's OK; locally implemented anonymous classes aren't re-usable
as such, so the fact that those implementations only worked in this
particular circumstance is fine, since the error will be exposed when
I attempt to move things around, as shown here.
