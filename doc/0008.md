# Key Insight

This particular green bar highlights one of two important aspects of
duplication that I missed on the first pass - when there are
no instructions, I can just copy the data from the input to the
output.

In other words, for this particular problem, the output is just
a different _view_ of the input document... not in its original
form, but after the model has performed its mutations to it.

The over all structure of the production code should start
to look like

 * build a document
 * "mutate" the document
 * view the document
