# Explicit message representations

One of the pain points I'm really starting to feel in the tests
as written thus far are the variations in spelling of the inputs.

My initial checks are based on reading a simulation scenario from
an input stream, and publishing the simulation result using a
writer.

Fundamentally, those are just representations of the values of
the model as streams of bytes.

In addition, I've got code dealing with the representations as
arrays of strings, or as lists.

These representations have the same meaning; but they are convenient
in different circumstances.

The common thing that they are describing is the initial conditions
of the simulation.

Most of the naming that I should be using is actually present in
the problem statement, I should just use it.
