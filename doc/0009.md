# Key Insight

The other key insight is that in working through this iterative
process, the way to "hard code" a result that we don't yet
understand how to iterate is to mutate the input to a problem
where we do understand how to do the iteration.

This also gives me a clear plan for mining new tests; I just
keep chipping away at the cheat until I no longer need it.
