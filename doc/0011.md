# Notes on recent refactorings

I realized I made an error early on, and needed to back out the 
consequences of that error.

What I discovered fairly early is that the initial interface for
running a check -- creating a sample file, wrapping it in streams,
etc -- was clumsy for iterating on specifying behaviors.  So I
created a bunch of "simpler" interfaces to work with.

As an activity, that's not wrong.  Part of the point of writing
the code out test first is to discover which bits are painful
to work with, and to invest in improving those interactions.

But... it was cart before the horse; I didn't need easier ways
to interact with the simulator.  Not yet.  What I needed was
an easier way to express the constraints that I was placing
on the implementation.  And that's primarily a _test_ concern.

The right answer was to take my simplified expressions of
new constraints, transform them in the test to align with
the existing API, and then pass them to the one entry point
that actually has external justification.

It still may turn out to be the case that I want an API that
allows me to get closer to the model -- for instance, an endpoint
that understands messages without being coupled to a specific
notion of IO.

A nice side effect of simplifying the API in this way is that
I can re-calibrate all of my tests with a single simple
change at one point in my implementation.
